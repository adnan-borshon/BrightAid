(must read the rule first for frontend)
1. For backend and frontend alignment first read the schema,  entities and their methods.. and from frontend read where this feature is being used (file can be used on various file) for reference.
2. Use context for data fetch and change.. it will help create a real time change for the whole website.
3. Dont change other thing logic. Only focus on the task
4. Dont make changes on entities name and attributes name.But you can add new methods on backend.
5. Make variables name align with backend so that its easier to understand.
6. for calculation if possible than you can do it on backend while using the native sql query.
7. for sql query use the basic things.
8. Dont change on the style in frontend.
9. if in my existing style inside the tags there are variable name like this {student.name}, which are not aligned with backend, you can change it..
